          <p>TAMPA, Fla. — It's that time of year again, sports fans. The playoffs are upon us and that means whether
            you're really into football, or not, you've found yourself at a tailgate, game or watch party.</p>
          <p>The Tampa Bay Buccaneers are once again on the quest to become Super Bowl champs. But this time, thanks to
            becoming the first to ever win at home, there's a bit more notoriety around the team.</p>


          <p>If you're scanning your brain for fun facts about the Bucs that are sure to impress even the most dedicated
            of fans but are coming up short — don't worry, we're here to help. A lot can happen in a team's 46-season
            history. Here are some fast facts you might not have known about the Tampa Bay area team:</p>
          <ol class="facts">
            <li>Not only were the Bucs the first to play in a Super Bowl at their home stadium, but they were the first
              team to ever win the championship at home.</li>
            <li>The most points Tampa Bay has scored during a playoff game is 48 against Oakland in 2003.</li>
            <li>The Vince Lombardi Trophy has called the Tampa Bay area home on two occasions: Super Bowl XXXVII and
              Super Bowl LV.</li>
            <li>This year marks the Buccaneers' 12th trip to the postseason.</li>
            <li>Tampa Bay's first kickoff was in 1976 after the team was awarded the NFL's 27th franchise.</li>
            <li>Are you superstitious? The Buccaneers' white jersey/pewter pants appear to bring them luck — and
              victories — during the regular season, playoffs and even in the Super Bowl. This year, the team is 10-0
              when wearing the uniform combo.</li>
            <li>During the 2020-21 season, the Buccaneers ended a 13-year long playoff drought.</li>
            <li>If the Bucs continue on a winning streak, they could become the first team to repeat as Super Bowl
              champions since the Brady-led New England Patriots 17 years ago. </li>
            <li>2021 marked the first time a Buccaneers' Super Bowl victory was celebrated with a boat parade. (Never
              forget the Lombardi toss by Brady.)</li>
            <li>The Buccaneers seem to have a magic number. In the team's recent playoff history, four of their last
              five matchups were won with 31-point scores.</li>
          </ol>
